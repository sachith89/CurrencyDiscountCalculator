# 💱 Currency Exchange and Discount Calculation API

## 📝 Project Description
This Spring Boot application integrates with a third-party currency exchange API to retrieve real-time exchange rates. It calculates the total payable amount for a bill in a specified currency after applying applicable discounts. The project demonstrates object-oriented design, authentication, testing, and modern coding practices.

---

## 📦 Features
- Real-time currency conversion using third-party APIs.
- Discounts based on user type and tenure.
- Supports flat discounts on bills over $100.
- Authentication for secure endpoints.

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- Java 23 with Spring Boot. 3.4.3
- Maven.
- JUnit5 and Mockito for testing.
- SonarQube for code quality.
- External Currency Exchange API (e.g., ExchangeRate-API or Open Exchange Rates).
